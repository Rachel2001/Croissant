      Croissants, the flaky and buttery pastries originating from France, have
      become an internationally beloved treat. Characterized by their crescent
      shape and delicate layers, croissants are made from a laminated dough that
      involves multiple folds of butter between layers of dough. This process
      results in a pastry with a light, airy interior and a crisp, golden-brown
      exterior. The rich and buttery flavor profile, combined with the
      irresistible texture, makes croissants a popular choice for breakfast or
      as a delightful accompaniment to coffee or tea. Whether enjoyed plain,
      filled with chocolate, or layered with ham and cheese, the humble
      croissant continues to captivate taste buds around the world, transcending
      cultural boundaries and bringing a touch of indulgence to daily rituals.
